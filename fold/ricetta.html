<p><u><del>This</del> recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</u> It has been <ins>adapted</ins> from a npes thatumber of different reci I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p><mark>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.</mark> It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

<p>1 can (400g) of <small>chick</small> peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
    <em>
        175g of tahini<br>
        Half a red pepper<br>
        6 sundried tomatoes<br>
        A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
        1 clove of garlic<br>
        A dash of olive oil</em></p>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</p>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h4>Storage</h4>

<p> the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it
    starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

<p>Hummus is <q>suitable</q> for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
